## How does it work?

Browser extensions do not have the ability to manage browser profiles. Instead the extension talks to a native program which has the ability to manipulate the browser folders (source code here: https://github.com/null-dev/firefox-profile-switcher-connector).

## Credits

Thanks to the authors of the Chromium project for creating the beautiful profile images.

Thanks to Mozilla for making this great browser and for creating the design language that this extension uses.

## License

The extension and native program are licensed under GPL v3.

The profile pictures were created by the Chromium authors and are licensed under the Chromium license, see: https://github.com/null-dev/firefox-profile-switcher/blob/master/public/img/avatars/LICENSE.txt.
