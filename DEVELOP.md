This template should help get you started developing a svelte web extension in Vite.

## Usage Notes

The extension manifest is defined in `src/manifest.js` and used by `@samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension` in the vite config.

Background, content scripts, options, and popup entry points exist in the `src/entries` directory. 

Content scripts are rendered by `src/entries/contentScript/renderContent.js` which renders content within a ShadowRoot
and handles style injection for HMR and build modes.

Otherwise, the project functions just like a regular Vite project.





Refer to [@samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension](https://github.com/samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension) for more usage notes.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```
## IDE Setup
### IDEA/WebStorm
`Use file extension` in the Code Styles options should be `never`.

## Commands
### Build
#### Development, HMR

Hot Module Reloading is used to load changes inline without requiring extension rebuilds and extension/page reloads
```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Development, Watch

Rebuilds extension on file changes. Requires a reload of the extension (and page reload if using content scripts)
```sh
npm run watch
```

#### Production

Minifies and optimizes extension build
```sh
npm run build
```

### Load extension in browser

Loads the contents of the dist directory into the specified browser
```sh
npm run serve:chrome
```

```sh
npm run serve:firefox
```
